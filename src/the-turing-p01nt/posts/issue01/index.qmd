### Director's Message 

Welcome to the first edition of the CRT-AI Newsletter. It is our pleasure to announce, this is The Turing Point. \
Our goal is to keep you informed of our latest developments and news and provide you with valuable information during your PhD journey. \
CRT-AI's newsletter committee is comprised of students across cohorts one through three. There are six committee members, and the advisory committee is composed of the six Co-Directors of the CRT-AI.

Whether people realize it or not, AI is now part of their daily lives, not a piece of fiction. A number of industries have become prominent for adopting artificial intelligence, including high tech and telecommunications, financial services, and healthcare. \
The growth of AI Corporate Investment worldwide, due to Covid-19 Pandemic, has accelerated in areas such as biotech, and the biggest increase has been in healthcare and pharma, and it appears that AI hiring, investment, and adoption have increased globally.\
The training of PhDs in this area is necessary to better meet the needs of the sector, improve efficiencies, and improve the future lives of millions of people. \
Last but not least, spring is approaching, and we all will be able to get up and moving again with plenty of fresh air around after a long period of hibernation. As you pursue your PhD, I wish you good health, happiness, and success. \
Please contact the newsletter committee through the CRT-AI Slack workspace if you would like to donate your time.
