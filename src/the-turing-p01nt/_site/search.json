    "text": "Deep Learning: Challenges faced by non-EU PhD researchers applying for Travel Visas\nJanet Choi Sr. Research Co-ordinator, SFI CRT in Artificial Intelligence Programme Co-ordinator\nAs an advocate for PhD students in our programme, the task was to facilitate the process of obtaining appointments for 23 students who were to attend an event at the University of Amsterdam.  \nThe process was by no means difficult, at first, I resolved to the fact that it would be a simple phone call. “Just make a call to VFS Global in Dublin, ask for the Embassy of the Netherlands, request for a group appointment.’’ I said to myself. \nI was on hold, after waiting for the standard opening welcome and was put on to an operator who couldn’t manage my request, I was transferred to a case manager. Who was going to really help me now, to get my 23 appointments before April 2024. This was June, so loads of time at hand. \n\nWhen Reality Meets Expectations\nI was wrong. \nI had a brief call with the case manager, who assured me that they could handle all 23 request in one day. I waited for the promised email, which came after the call to thank me for my phone call and dealing with VFS global. I waited, and waited for details any details of times and dates for the appointments. Days and weeks passed.\nAnother phone call attempted again to reach the same case manager who was so happy to facilitate me in our first phone call.  Not to be boring, but this resulted in more than 20+ phone calls by landline and mobile to gain clarity on the appointment dates and times. Between calls, I would receive email acknowledgement emails were digitally signed with a Dublin address, but in actuality the call centre was based in Mumbai. On several occasions, I had received multiple missed calls from unknown numbers, followed by emails from VFS Global stating that they tried to contact unsuccessfully which delayed the process by a day. A survey by email would promptly follow the initial email. \nLong story short, from all 23 appointments being able to manage in one day, the discussion was hijacked, and appointments reduced, down from all, to 6 per day, down from 6 to 4 per day and finally 2 per day as the days went on. A painful call came when a family appointment for 4 (which was to be processed altogether) was split to two individual appointments on two separate days. \nI felt sick with worry multiple times seeing students’ disappointment. This trip, the programme’s first international one, was too important to fail. I couldn’t let all the effort spent on meetings, discussions, and countless emails with Amsterdam AI and the PhDs be wasted. The time invested in securing flights and accommodation before applications even opened felt at risk.\n\n\nRequired Documents for Each Student\nThe trips required the following documents, and in future I would advise all the students to do this, have a portfolio ready of all the documents required as listed below on their person when granted a visit to VFS Global. \n\n\nAgenda/Itinerary for the visit on visiting site Letterhead\nLetter of Invitation from the institution/conference/event\nFlights and accommodation booked\nLetter of Support from their institution\nTravel Insurance (personal and institutional)\nBank Statements\n3 months’ pay slips\nFully completed Application \nVFS Global email invitation\nFee \n\nIn all 40 of us made the visit across to The Netherland’s and springboarded some to apply for their Schengen Visa. \n\n\nLessons Learned\nConsidering the current monopoly that VFS global have as the single operator for a majority of Embassies who rely on their service, I would say that their service is severely restrictive, and mediocre at best. \nFrom their webpage, they state leveraging a robust experience in visa application processing, providing government with a holistic administrative solution to processing passport applications and provision of efficient consular services. https://www.vfsglobal.com/en/individuals/about.html\nNot to mention, that if the appointment is early morning and one is travelling from Galway, Limerick or Cork the journey taken to make the appointment by car, train or bus is an additional time that needs to be factored in and in my view, if one cannot secure a visa appointment through their website, it could take 6-9 months to actually get one. Or contact that them directly, keeping in mind that you’ll need to persistently seek updates and clarification until a confirmed appointment time and date is provided."

Researchers from third level institutions and guests from industry were in attendance. During the event, the panelists shared their career stories; from where they started to where they currently are. They did not fail to bring in the good, bad, and ugly as the theme of the event was Diversity Driving Innovation. This was a very topical issue and the aim was to increase awareness around women’s participation in the IT sector.\n    ​Dr Suzanne Little opened with a discussion around her career and research to date and mentioned that she had no intention of becoming a lecturer at the start of her career. She also touched upon on how she seized opportunities and how her ambitions and  curiosity positively impacted her life.\n   Joanna Murphy also contributed to her story of how she switched between jobs and ultimately reached her current position. She stressed the fact that it was not always plain sailing. During the meet up, participants had the opportunity to ask questions about how industries are adapting culturally to include more women in their organizations. Dr Little touched upon the fact that just reaching out to other females to encourage them to enter the field is not enough. \n    Eoin Lane shared a story about a female colleague in his department that was performing remarkably well and yet left the industry. He asked the panel and audience what were the factors that could affect women’s decision making when considering career change or moves out of the industry."
