    "text": "Deep Learning: Challenges faced by non-EU PhD researchers applying for Travel Visas\nBy: Janet Choi Sr. Research Co-ordinator, SFI CRT in Artificial Intelligence Programme Manager\nIn June of 2023, the team at CRT in AI co-ordinated a visit to The University of Amsterdam scheduled for April 2024. For our non -EU PhD Researchers, this meant that travel visas were required, and I wanted to help secure these appointments for them. I only needed 23, so I resolved to the fact that it would be a simple phone call. \n“Just make the call to VFS Global in Dublin, ask for the Embassy of the Netherlands, request for a group appointment.’’ I said to myself. \nMaking the call, I was placed on hold, waiting for the standard opening welcome and was put on to an operator who couldn’t manage my request. I was transferred to a case manager. Who I thought, was really going to help me now. Getting rather excited, I thought, I would get my 23 appointments before April 2024. This was June 2023, so loads of time at hand. I was wrong.\n\nWhen Reality Meets Expectations\nI had a brief call with the case manager, who assured me that the Dublin office would handle all 23 requests in one day. They would email me the details.\n\nI waited for the promised email, which came promptly after the call, an acknowledgement email thanking me for my phone call and dealing with VFS global each time. \nI waited, and waited for appointment details. Anticipating details of the times and dates for the in person appointments, my email reminders to VFS mostly unanswered, became common place, and days turned to weeks. \nAnother phone call, attempted again to reach the same case manager, who was so happy to facilitate me on the first phone call. Resulted in more than 20+ phone calls by landline and mobile to gain clarity on the appointment dates and times. Between calls, I would receive email acknowledgements. Emails that were digitally signed with a Dublin address, but in actuality the call centre was based in Mumbai. \nOn several occasions, I received multiple missed calls from unknown numbers, followed by emails from VFS Global stating that they tried to contact me unsuccessfully which delayed the process by 24-48 hours. A satisfaction survey by email would promptly follow the initial email. These numbers were international numbers that I did not recognise, so promptly did not answer these. \nA long story made short, from the promise of all 23 appointments being managed all in one day, the conversation went on a vertical descent, and appointments reduced, down from all, to 6 per day, descending down from 6 to 4 per day and spiralling to 2 per day as the days went on. \nFollow up calls, for a family appointment for 4 (which was requested to be processed together) was split to two individual appointments on two separate days, with the group travelling outside of Dublin on two separate occasions.\nThis trip, the programme’s first international one, was too important to fail. I couldn’t let all the effort spent on meetings, discussions, and countless emails with Amsterdam AI and the PhDs be wasted. The time invested in securing flights and accommodation before applications even opened felt at risk. I felt sick with worry, on multiple occasions, seeing in my minds eye the students’ disappointment.\n\n\nRequired Documents for Each Student\nThe Embassy required the following documents, and in future I would advise all the students to do this, have a portfolio ready of all the documents required as listed below on their person when granted a visit to VFS Global. The list below is mandatory. \n\nAgenda/Itinerary for the visit on visiting site Letterhead\nLetter of Invitation from the institution/conference/event\nFlights and accommodation booked- Travel Itinerary\nLetter of Support from their institution - Sponsor Letter\nTravel Insurance (personal and institutional)\n3 months Bank Statements\n3 months’ pay slips\nFully completed VFS Application \nVFS Global email invitation \nFee \n\n\n\nLessons Learned\nIn all, 40 of us made the visit across to The Netherland’s and the visa applications approved by the The Netherland’s, springboarded some PhD Researchers to be able to apply for a Schengen Visa. \nConsidering the monopoly that VFS global have as the single operator for a majority of Embassies who rely on their service, I would say that their service is severely restrictive, and mediocre at best. \nFrom their webpage, they state leveraging a robust experience in visa application processing, providing governments with a holistic administrative solution to processing passport applications and provision of efficient consular services. Which left me with no comment. See https://www.vfsglobal.com/en/individuals/about.html\nNot to add, one needs to account for the extra time and money needed for the trip if the appointment was early in the morning and they were coming from Galway, Limerick, or Cork.\nIn my opinion,It may take six to nine months to really obtain a visa, if one is unable to schedule an appointment  through their website.\nMy advice, is to contact VFS directly, keeping in mind that the applicant will  need to persistently seek updates and clarification until a confirmed appointment time and date is provided.\nTravelling without the need for a visa is an honour, shedding light on the stark differences in global mobility. This undertaking, underscored the inherent privilege enjoyed by those who can travel freely and frequently, unburdened by the often cumbersome visa application process."

Researchers from third level institutions and guests from industry were in attendance. During the event, the panelists shared their career stories; from where they started to where they currently are. They did not fail to bring in the good, bad, and ugly as the theme of the event was Diversity Driving Innovation. This was a very topical issue and the aim was to increase awareness around women’s participation in the IT sector.\n    ​Dr Suzanne Little opened with a discussion around her career and research to date and mentioned that she had no intention of becoming a lecturer at the start of her career. She also touched upon on how she seized opportunities and how her ambitions and  curiosity positively impacted her life.\n   Joanna Murphy also contributed to her story of how she switched between jobs and ultimately reached her current position. She stressed the fact that it was not always plain sailing. During the meet up, participants had the opportunity to ask questions about how industries are adapting culturally to include more women in their organizations. Dr Little touched upon the fact that just reaching out to other females to encourage them to enter the field is not enough. \n    Eoin Lane shared a story about a female colleague in his department that was performing remarkably well and yet left the industry. He asked the panel and audience what were the factors that could affect women’s decision making when considering career change or moves out of the industry."
