    "text": "Welcoming words\nWelcome to the second issue of the CRT-AI Newsletter “The Turing Point”. This time we talk about bias in AI. Even though the topic has received quite a lot of attention in recent years, the level of awareness remains low. Knowing what tools a scientist can use to spot, evaluate and mitigate any form of bias is of great importance. For this issue, our team prepared a list of interesting articles, tools and datasets that can help you on your PhD ​​​​​journey."

    "text": "Professor O’Sullivan ​Director of The Centre for Research Training in Artificial Intelligence\n\n\n\nDirector’s Message \nWelcome to the first edition of the CRT-AI Newsletter. It is our pleasure to announce, this is The Turing Point. \nOur goal is to keep you informed of our latest developments and news and provide you with valuable information during your PhD journey. \nCRT-AI’s newsletter committee is comprised of students across cohorts one through three. There are six committee members, and the advisory committee is composed of the six Co-Directors of the CRT-AI.\nWhether people realize it or not, AI is now part of their daily lives, not a piece of fiction. A number of industries have become prominent for adopting artificial intelligence, including high tech and telecommunications, financial services, and healthcare. \nThe growth of AI Corporate Investment worldwide, due to Covid-19 Pandemic, has accelerated in areas such as biotech, and the biggest increase has been in healthcare and pharma, and it appears that AI hiring, investment, and adoption have increased globally.\nThe training of PhDs in this area is necessary to better meet the needs of the sector, improve efficiencies, and improve the future lives of millions of people. \nLast but not least, spring is approaching, and we all will be able to get up and moving again with plenty of fresh air around after a long period of hibernation. As you pursue your PhD, I wish you good health, happiness, and success. \nPlease contact the newsletter committee through the CRT-AI Slack workspace if you would like to donate your time."
